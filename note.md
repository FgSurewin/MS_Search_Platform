Questions:
1. When should I count the start time? (After initializing the app OR When the user enter the first query?)


Logic:
2. When we count the browsing time (duration) of the clicked link, the following actions will be considered as ending operations.
* When the user clicks the next link, we will terminate the count and calculate the duration.
* When the user makes a new query ......
* When the user moves forward or backward.
