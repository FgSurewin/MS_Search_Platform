        In each task you will be shown the make, model, and trim of two SUVs and

        Your goal is to choose the SUV that has the{" "}
        <b>largest amount of total cargo space for its length.</b> In other
        words, you want to compare the ratio of{" "}

        By <b>total cargo space</b> we mean the maximum amount of space behind
        the driverâ€™s seat (i.e., with all other rows folded down). This is
        typically measured in cubic feet.

        By <b>total length</b> we mean the exterior length of the SUV from the
